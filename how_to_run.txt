## Football Standings Scraper Script

**Run the script in Linux-based environments**

The `script.py` script scrapes the Sky Sports site to retrieve football league standings from 2000 to 2022.

### Installation

Run the following command to install all the required packages and dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### How it Works

1. The script utilizes the `requests` package to make requests to the URL generated based on the user's selection of the league and year.

2. It employs the `BeautifulSoup` package to extract the necessary data from the HTML of the page, specifically focusing on tables.

3. The user is prompted to enter their MySQL username (use 'root' for the default).

4. The script then prompts the user to enter the MySQL password (press Enter if no password is set). The script uses the `getpass()` function from the `getpass` package to securely retrieve the password without echoing it back to the output stream.

5. The username and password from steps 3 and 4 are used to connect to the MySQL server.

6. The script uses `pymysql` to create the database with the user-input name if it doesn't already exist.

It utilizes the `peewee` ORM to dynamically create tables based on user input and populate them with data retrieved from the Sky Sports site.

### Table Schema

The table schema is as follows:

- 'standing': IntegerField()
- 'team': CharField()
- 'matches_played': IntegerField()
- 'matches_won': IntegerField()
- 'matches_drawn': IntegerField()
- 'matches_lost': IntegerField()
- 'goals_for': IntegerField()
- 'goals_against': IntegerField()
- 'goal_difference': IntegerField()
- 'points': IntegerField()

Feel free to run the script and explore football standings data for your preferred league and years!
